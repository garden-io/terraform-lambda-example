# Garden Example for Terraform Lambda

TODO: Write the actual README. For now, you should know that:

- This is using our AWS dev account (I was locally authenticated when
I set this up)
- This is using a version of the Garden CLI that hasn't been merged to
  main (as of writing). You'll need to remove the `backendConfig` part
  from the `project.garden.yml` file to get it working with current
versions of Garden.
- The `zip-lambda` exec action isn't working for some reason. You'd
need to run the script manually for now.
